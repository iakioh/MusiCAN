Training info: 10k-vanilla-musegan
=======================

models: MusiGen, MusiDis (note [1])
dataset: lpd5_full_4bars

rounds = 10000
batch_size = 25
discriminator_rounds = 5
loss_function = WGAN-GP

adam_optimizer_params:
    gen: (lr = 0.001, betas = (0.5, 0.9))
    dis: (lr = 0.001, betas = (0.5, 0.9))

additional comments:
    Training to see if as-close-as-possible hyperparameter settings to museGAN 
    paper allow replication of their performance
    
    [1] Generator output layer is set to be only binarized if in testing mode
        (museGAN setting)
